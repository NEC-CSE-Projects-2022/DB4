    <h1>Monkeypox Disease Awareness</h1>
    <p>
        Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral illness caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb). In 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by the clade IIb strain. 
        Mpox continues to be a threat today, and an upsurge of cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries caused by clades Ia and Ib has raised concern.<br>
        <br>There are vaccines for mpox. Vaccination should be considered along with other public health interventions. 
        Common symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes. <br>
        Mpox can be transmitted through close contact with someone who has mpox, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals. During pregnancy, the virus may be passed to the fetus, or to the newborn during or after birth.<br>
        <br>Mpox is treated with supportive care for symptoms such as pain and fever, with close attention to nutrition, hydration, skin care, prevention of secondary infections and treatment of co-infections, including HIV where present.

    <h3>🦠 What is Monkeypox?</h3>
    <p>
        Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals
        to humans. Human-to-human transmission occurs through close physical
        contact, respiratory droplets, or contaminated materials.
    </p>

    <h3> Common Symptoms : </h3>
    <p>
        Signs and symptoms 
Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1–21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. 

<ul>Common symptoms of mpox are: 

<li>rash</li>
<li></li>fever</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>muscle aches</li>
<li>back pain</li>
low energy 
swollen lymph nodes.  
For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first.  </ul>

<br>The mpox rash often begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off. 

Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including: 

<ul>
<li>palms of hands and soles of feet</li>
<li>face, mouth and throat</li>
<li>groin and genital areas</li>
<li>anus.</li>
</ul>

<br>Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing. <br>

<br>People with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is.  <br>

<br>Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox. <br>

Some people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage.<br> <br> Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis). Mpox can be fatal in some cases.

    <h3> How Monkeypox Spreads : </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct contact with infected skin lesions</li>
        <li>Respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact</li>
        <li>Contaminated clothing, bedding, or towels</li>
        <li>Contact with infected animals</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Prevention Measures : </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid close contact with infected individuals</li>
        <li>Maintain proper hand hygiene</li>
        <li>Use personal protective equipment when required</li>
        <li>Isolate suspected cases promptly</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Treatment & Care : </h3>
    <p>
        There is currently no specific cure for Monkeypox. Treatment mainly
        focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing complications.
        Patients are advised to seek medical care for proper diagnosis and
        guidance.
